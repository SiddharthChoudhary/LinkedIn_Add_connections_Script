# LinkedIn_Add_connections_Script
This script can be used to grow targeted network connections. It can help you connect to your targeted companies' connections. 

Add the script in your console tab in Inspect element, and run it. And see the magic.
Remember:- 
1.) to not violate linkedIn rules, 
2.) I do not encourage to disregard linkedIn policy for connections.
3.) This one is just for an experiment purpose

To use the script, your page should have buttons saying "Connect". 
To use:- Search your target company in the linkedIn search bar. Select people and you should see a list with a pagination view.
Once you have that, you can run the script there.
